# group-huibrm
Our group is re-building and designing the WINFO page.
In addtition to current features, we will add Google calendar (working with google API), revamp events, add officer personal statements, previous officers, WINFO history, all on seperate pages. 
Mary will be in charge of working with Google API, calendar
Sephanie and Min will be in charge of back-end functionality 
Echo will be in charge of creative design
All members will be contributing to all portions, however, this is an idea of how the workload will be distributed. We are planning on using Bootstrap and css for design
