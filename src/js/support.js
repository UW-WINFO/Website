            Becoming a sponsor can help your company’s public relations, brand perception, and product popularity. By sponsoring our hackathon event, you and your company can connect directly with young talent at the event.

This event is a perfect way for you to find future interns and full-time engineers, designers, and product managers. Further, by helping us provide a safe and collaborative environment for all students to create technology, you help our goal of increasing diversity within the tech industry.

            <p>We understand that it is not always possible to provide monetary support, so we have listed some alternative items below that are essential to the success of the hackathon.
            <br/><br/>
            <ol>
              <li>
              Sending Mentors - Mentors play an extremely important role in guiding students to build successful products. This is also an excellent opportunity for your company to build relationships with young computer scientists, designers, and project managers. Students always appreciate the guidance and expertise you provide.
              </li>
              <br/>
              <li>
              Food (Meals, snacks and drinks) - Food is a very important part of our Hackathon! We want to make sure our participants are well fed to help fuel their creativity. You can help by powering the hackathon with meals and refreshments. (College students love pizza).
              </li>
              <br/>
              <li>
              Small items to give away (aka. Swag) - Swag is always a great perk to attending a Hackathon. This can be in the form of t-shirts, stickers, mugs, pens, notebooks, etc. If you have enough swag to give to a good portion of our participants (approximately 100 students), it would be a great item to bring! This is another way to ensure that participants have exposure to your brand.
              </li>
              <br/>
              <li>
              Prizes - Prizes will be used either for random giveaways or for our ranking winners. It would be great for participants to see an awesome prize for ranking in the hackathon!
